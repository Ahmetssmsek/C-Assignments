C++ Assignments
This repository contains several C++ programs implementing data structures and algorithms for educational purposes. Below is a description of each file:

1. 12.2.cpp - Queue-Based Merge Sort
This program demonstrates the merge sort algorithm using queues.

The user enters a series of numbers, which are then split into individual queues.
Pairs of queues are merged in sorted order until only one queue remains.
The final output is a single queue containing all the numbers in sorted order.
2. 8.4.cpp - Balanced Parentheses Checker
This program checks if a given string contains balanced parentheses.

The user inputs a string consisting of parentheses ((), {}, []).
A stack data structure is used to validate if the parentheses are balanced.
The program outputs "Balanced" if the parentheses are valid and "Not Balanced" otherwise.
3. 11.3.cpp - Priority Queue Implementation
This program demonstrates a simple priority queue implementation.

Elements are pushed into the queue with a priority value.
Higher-priority elements are dequeued before lower-priority elements.
This is illustrated with a series of names and priority levels for practice.
